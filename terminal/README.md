# Tips and tricks for shell usage

## History

Remember to use arrow keys up and down to move in history. 
Arrow up takes you through your command history.

## Tab completion 

You do not need to write the whole command, directory or file name.
Say you want to start python, write ``pyt`` and hit your Tab-key. Your 
command shell will probably complete to ``python``.

If you want to move into the directory ``kvittr-v1``, type ``cd kv`` and hit 
your Tab-key. Your command shell will probably complete for you. 

This is called ``tab-completion``, and is a very powerful tool in your 
everyday workflow.
